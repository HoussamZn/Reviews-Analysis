I tested it and my results confirmed advertised speeds so I'm very pleased with that. I put this in my main gaming rig, it doesn't generate a ton of heat that I can tell. My system remains very cool so I doubt this guy gets particularly hot. I'm not doing anything that would stress it out other than when I benchmarked it. When I built my system, I popped it in, the system found it, we installed an OS on it so perfectly compatible with my systems bios. Gaming performance like I said I can't complain. I'm not doing anything that would really stress this guy out as its crazy fast. It fit perfectly in the m.2 slot, and it's been perfectly reliable for the last 3months since I built it. I got this at the recommendation of a buddy of mine who builds pc's all the time."

Plug-and-play setup was super easy, and all four ports work without any issues. The USB 3.0 speeds are fast, so transferring files doesn’t slow down, and it handles multiple devices at once with no lag.The build quality feels decent—not super heavy-duty, but good enough for everyday use. It’s compact and lightweight, which makes it easy to throw in a bag for travel. Works perfectly for connecting flash drives, external hard drives, keyboards, and other accessories.If you need a simple, affordable USB hub that works reliably, this is a great pick!"

It has delivered exceptional performance for both casual and demanding use. Built on SK hynix’s cutting-edge 176-layer NAND technology, it stands out for its incredible read and write speeds. These speeds make it an excellent choice for gamers, content creators, and professionals who require lightning-fast data access and multitasking capabilities.One of the most impressive aspects of the Platinum P41 is its reliability. With an impressive endurance rating of 1,200 TBW (terabytes written) and a 5-year warranty, it offers peace of mind for long-term use. SK hynix’s focus on thermal management is evident, as the drive stays remarkably cool under load.The drive also excels in real-world scenarios, making it perfect for large file transfers, 4K video editing, and gaming, where reduced loading times truly shine. The inclusion of software tools like SK hynix's \"Easy Kit\" further enhances the user experience, offering straightforward drive management and firmware updates.Overall, it has been my experience that the Platinum P41 blends top-tier performance, durability, and value in a single package. Whether you're upgrading your gaming rig or boosting the performance of a workstation, this SSD is a worthwhile investment that won’t disappoint. So far - I've bought two of these - & I'm getting a third soon.  [The 1TB version are also highly reliable - I have a few of those in some laptops.]"

Many of the 24\" displays are 1080 which I didn't want, so this one caught my attention. But I was a bit skeptical considering the low price and a company name I wasn't familiar with. After checking the specs and reading the reviews I was sold. The picture quality was great right out of the box. It initially scaled to 125% which is what I used on my old monitor, and it was usable but still a little small for my eyes, so I set it to 150%. The high pixel count provides a nice sharp picture. The color, brightness and contrast are excellent from edge to edge. I did tweak the picture setting just a bit, to my taste; I like the toggle switch it uses for this function, a clever idea.

I am not a gamer so this is not a review of suitability. Amazing that a display in this price range is even of interest to gamers.The display is beautiful. It is far brighter with far more adjustment than I will ever use. The picture viewing angle is reasonable, there is very little variation side to side when looking directly at the monitor, better than my laptop display. There is minimal backlight bleed, especially for an inexpensive ips panel. There is a stuck pixel, or possibly a cluster of 2 in the lower right corner--ymmv. They have an explicit pixel guarantee you can check out on their website.If anyone is looking for power buttons or controls, it is all in the joystick on the back right corner. Just hold down 3 seconds to power off. Menu is very intuitive.I'm using vesa 100 mount, so can't speak to the stand. The only issue is that the screws I have are a little long--they won't tighten down all the way. No mounting screws included. But no issue with stability or usability once mounted.I'm running this at qhd 75hz, which is all my hdmi-display port adapter will support. Can't verify 100hz. It's more than fine for me.All in all, I couldn't be happier. Hope it holds up.I hadn't heard of KTC. Turns out they are an established, global company. They have a real CS team that returned my email overnight. They confirmed  that all of their monitors have a three-year warranty.

These speeds make it an excellent choice for gamers, content creators, and professionals who require lightning-fast data access and multitasking capabilities.One of the most impressive aspects of the Platinum P41 is its reliability. With an impressive endurance rating of 1,200 TBW (terabytes written) and a 5-year warranty, it offers peace of mind for long-term use. SK hynix’s focus on thermal management is evident, as the drive stays remarkably cool under load.The drive also excels in real-world scenarios, making it perfect for large file transfers, 4K video editing, and gaming, where reduced loading times truly shine. The inclusion of software tools like SK hynix's \"Easy Kit\" further enhances the user experience, offering straightforward drive management and firmware updates.Overall, it has been my experience that the Platinum P41 blends top-tier performance, durability, and value in a single package. Whether you're upgrading your gaming rig or boosting the performance of a workstation, this SSD is a worthwhile investment that won’t disappoint.

I am not a gamer so this is not a review of suitability. Amazing that a display in this price range is even of interest to gamers.The display is beautiful. It is far brighter with far more adjustment than I will ever use. The picture viewing angle is reasonable, there is very little variation side to side when looking directly at the monitor, better than my laptop display. There is minimal backlight bleed, especially for an inexpensive ips panel. There is a stuck pixel, or possibly a cluster of 2 in the lower right corner--ymmv. They have an explicit pixel guarantee you can check out on their website.If anyone is looking for power buttons or controls, it is all in the joystick on the back right corner. Just hold down 3 seconds to power off. Menu is very intuitive.I'm using vesa 100 mount, so can't speak to the stand. The only issue is that the screws I have are a little long--they won't tighten down all the way. No mounting screws included. But no issue with stability or usability once mounted.I'm running this at qhd 75hz, which is all my hdmi-display port adapter will support. Can't verify 100hz. It's more than fine for me.All in all, I couldn't be happier. Hope it holds up.I hadn't heard of KTC. Turns out they are an established, global company.

Super reliable, and fast. On Linux this thing is a rocket. Keep in mind if you’re putting these on a motherboard with built-in heat sinks, you may need an extra rubber support pad because this is only a single sided SSD and it may bend under the heat sink otherwise. I can’t wait for the PCIe 5.0 version! SK Hynix for life!"

Many of the 24\" displays are 1080 which I didn't want, so this one caught my attention. But I was a bit skeptical considering the low price and a company name I wasn't familiar with. After checking the specs and reading the reviews I was sold. The picture quality was great right out of the box. It initially scaled to 125% which is what I used on my old monitor, and it was usable but still a little small for my eyes, so I set it to 150%. The high pixel count provides a nice sharp picture. The color, brightness and contrast are excellent from edge to edge. I did tweak the picture setting just a bit, to my taste; I like the toggle switch it uses for this function, a clever idea.  If you want a high-quality monitor at an affordable price this is a good one to consider."

I originally cloned my 250GB OS drive to one of these, and it worked flawlessly. The performance is excellent, with fast load times and stable temps thanks to the built-in heatsink.I ended up buying a second one because the price was too good to pass up.

It has delivered exceptional performance for both casual and demanding use. Built on SK hynix’s cutting-edge 176-layer NAND technology, it stands out for its incredible read and write speeds. These speeds make it an excellent choice for gamers, content creators, and professionals who require lightning-fast data access and multitasking capabilities.One of the most impressive aspects of the Platinum P41 is its reliability. With an impressive endurance rating of 1,200 TBW (terabytes written) and a 5-year warranty, it offers peace of mind for long-term use. SK hynix’s focus on thermal management is evident, as the drive stays remarkably cool under load.The drive also excels in real-world scenarios, making it perfect for large file transfers, 4K video editing, and gaming, where reduced loading times truly shine. The inclusion of software tools like SK hynix's \"Easy Kit\" further enhances the user experience, offering straightforward drive management and firmware updates.Overall, it has been my experience that the Platinum P41 blends top-tier performance, durability, and value in a single package. Whether you're upgrading your gaming rig or boosting the performance of a workstation, this SSD is a worthwhile investment that won’t disappoint. So far - I've bought two of these - & I'm getting a third soon.  [The 1TB version are also highly reliable - I have a few of those in some laptops.]"
